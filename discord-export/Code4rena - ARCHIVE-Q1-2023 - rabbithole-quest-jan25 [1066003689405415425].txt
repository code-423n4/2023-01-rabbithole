@SovaSlava there were some last-minute changes we were sneaking in which caused the start date to move back, which ultimately made more sense to extend the timeline since we would now be going through a weekend.

Just in the essence of broader answers (in case others have same question too). 

> Who calls the functions in the *renderer.sol contracts, how and where are the images and attributes displayed?

They are called in the tokenUri fx in the receipt contract and the uri fx in the tickets contract. They return base64 encoded strings that decode to json objects that comply to the the OS metadata standards: https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure . The image is a base64 encoded svg.

I've had a few questions regarding RabbitHoleTickets.sol - this is an 1155 contract that is used as a reward for an ERC-1155 Quest.


[01/26/2023 13:35] garrettjmu
I've also had a few questions regarding checking rewardAllowList for 1155. That's really only used for internal use for now. So no need to necessarily restrict it, since it'll only be RabbitHole that runs 1155 Quests (for now)


[01/26/2023 15:28] garrettjmu
Hey Akshay!

Sorry I missed this. If I'm understanding the question right, we are using the OZ transparent proxy: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy

Why are rabbit hole receipts upgradeable?


[01/26/2023 17:05] garrettjmu
Mainly for the metadata. Even though we can essentially upgrade the renderer by deploying a new renderer contract, we might want to pass more data into the renderer.

One question regarding the scope 👁️ 
What's the reason that sloc described are different from ones of the real contracts?
The real contract has 230 sloc even if it describes that Questfactory has 162 sloc.

I've also had a handful of questions regarding the ClaimSigner. There are checks for start and end off-chain where that happens 👍

It won't issue hashes before the Quest Start or after the Quest End. It also tracks number of receipt redeemers so knows when totalParticipants has been hit.

How can RabbitHoleTickets.sol used in the project?


[01/27/2023 15:57] garrettjmu
Hey!

RabbitHoleTickets is an example of an ERC-1155 Reward and would be the underlying ERC-1155 contract for RH deploying an ERC-1155 Quest

Hey all. I have another common question I've been getting around the vein of:

> How can a user have more than one claimable receipt?

It's a great question. So they can only mint 1 receipt per quest BUT in theory they could have 2 receipts over time. Here's a concrete example:

Quest A is live to swap on Uniswap with a reward of 1 UNI erc-20 token
- You and I both do the action
- We both mint a receipt
- I hate the UNI token so I sell you my receipt for a small amount of ETH
- You now have two receipts that are eligible to claim a reward
- You claim 2 rewards

good luck to all, it has been a fun project.


[01/30/2023 20:19] pfapostol
in/valids is not the only issue. I think one particular high will cost very little due to the large number of duplicates. 
But it's better not to discuss vulnerabilities until the report is published.


[01/30/2023 20:26] manikantanynala97
but should I know tell it even after the contest


[01/30/2023 20:27] manikantanynala97
ok sure I will not tell once again

I want to know how well I've been doing to improve myself


[01/31/2023 08:14] pfapostol
You can improve yourself by reading other people's reports. But in fact, the best way is to practice and understand each specific project.

You can join backstage if you'd like to see the findings before they are published in the report. I'd recommend this as you'll get better feedback on your issues and more quickly.


[02/26/2023 23:08] kirk_baird
Not yet, usually about ~1 week between announcement and payment


[02/27/2023 06:43] 0x3b
how do you join backstage?

@xAriextz  You need to wait for the report to come out (probably another week or two) or you can get backstage access but that requires you to have done a few contests https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/certified-contributors/backstage-wardens
